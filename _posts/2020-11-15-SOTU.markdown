### Where you're at now

  Right now, I feel like I am getting a better understanding the technical aspect of design. Working in a terminal and learning how to use different programs to create what I want to see visually and having to make sure I've set up my work space to send the updates correctly is a lot different from what I am used to doing (ex: code something in the backend and hitting preview to see changes versus pushing updates).

### What you're looking forward to

  As I am doing research for the design of the doggy daycare website, I'm finding that I actually enjoy learning more about the human experience with design. In fact, prior to doing the research, I had thought that I wanted to do more desktop website designs, but I think as I am continuing to look at other people's work and how they came to creating their site, I am interested in pursuing mobile-related design work whether that is creating a website or an application.

### Goals
    
1. Being able to format my lines of code properly
2. Understanding terminology (this will just require me memorizing terms)
3. Getting more acquainted with Figma (may consider purchasing a Sketch license for the MBP in the future)
4.  Understanding GitHub and branching

### Hopes

One of my hopes is that even if I don't necessarily understand everything by the end of the apprenticeship, that I know enough to be able to continue learning more of what it is that I truly want to do on my own.

### Fears

1. Accidentally breaking something beyond repair in the terminal
2. Feeling like I am dependent on a crutch like constantly web searching for my answers rather than knowing what to do in most cases

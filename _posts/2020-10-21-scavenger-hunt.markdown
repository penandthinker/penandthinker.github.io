        <font style="font-family:Gill Sans MT; font-size:18pt;">Gill Sans Example</font>
      </ol>

      </ol>
</ul>

### Anatomy of Type
<ul>
  Regular: Also known as plain or regular is the standard upright version of a typeface. It is usually known as the parent of a larger family.
    <ol>
      <font style="font-family:Bodoni MT; font-weight:normal; font-size:18pt;">Bodoni MT</font>
    </ol>
  Pro Italic: Italic form is used to create emphasis. It employs shapes and strokes distinct from its regular counterpart.
    <ol>
      <font style="font-family:Bodoni MT; font-weight:normal; font-style:italic; font-size:18pt;">Bodoni MT</font>
      </ol>
  Pro Regular (All Small Caps): Small caps (capitals) are designed to integrate with a line of text. Full-size capitals would stand out awkwardly. They are slightly taller than the x-height of lowercase letters.
    <ol>
      <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cinzel' rel='stylesheet'>
        <font style="font-family:cinzel; font-weight:normal; font-size:18pt;">Cinzel</font>
    </ol>
  Pro Bold and Semibold: Bold version of regular text fonts are for emphatic forms. Bold has a broad range of weights (thin, bold, black, etc.)
    <ol>
      <font style="font-family:Bodoni MT; font-weight:600; font-size:18pt;">Bodoni MT</font>
      </ol>
  Pro Bold and Semibold Italic: When a typeface designer tries to make the two bold versions feel similar to the regular without making the overall form too heavy.
    <ol>
      <font style="font-family:Bodoni MT; font-weight:800; font-size:18pt;">Bodoni MT</font>
      </ol>
</ul>

### Letterforms

Type| Definition |
|----|----|
Stroke | Any line that defines the basic letterform
Apex/Vertex | The point created by joining two diagonal stems (apex above, vertex below)
Arm | Short strokes off the stem of the letterform, either horizontal (E, F, T) or inclined upward (K, Y)
Baseline | The imaginary line defining the visual base of letterforms
Ascender | The portion of the stem of a lowercase letterform that projects above the median
Median | The imaginary line defining the x-height of letterforms
X-height | The height in any typeface of the lowercase 'x'
Barb | The half-serif finish on some curved strokes (C, G, S)
Beak | The half-serif finish on some horizontal arms (E, T, L)
Cross Bar | The horizontal stroke in a letterform that joins two stems together (A, H)
Stroke | Any line that defines the basic letterform
Ear | The stroke extending out from the main stem or body of the letterform
Bowl | The rounded form that describes a counter. The bowl may be either open or closed (b, d, p, q)
Cross Stroke | The horizontal stroke in a letterform that intersects the stem (f, t)
Em/en | Originally referring to the width of an uppercase M, an em is now the distance equal to the size of he typeface (em in 48 pt. type is 48 points). An en is half the size of an em. Most often used to describe m.en spaces and em/en dashes
Bracket | The transition between the serif and the stem
Crotch | The interior space where two strokes meet (K, V)
Finial | The rounded non-serif terminal to a froke <font style="background-color:yellow;">(can this be imilar to an ear but rounded?)</font>
Counter | The negative space within a letterform, either fully or partially enclosed. (a, d, P, C)
Descender | That portion of the stem of a lowercase letterform that projects below the baseline (p, q, y)
Leg | Short strokes off the stem of the letterform, either at the bottom of the stroke (L) or inclined ownward (K, R)
Legature | The character formed by the combination of two or more letterforms <font tyle="background-color:yellow;">(shortened kern?)</font>
Shoulder | The surved stroke that is not part of a bowl (h, n)
Stress | The orientation of the letterform, indicated by the thin stroke in round forms
Link | The stroke that connects the bowl and the loop of a lowercase G
Spine | The curved stem of the S
Swash | The flourish that extends the stroke of a letterform (usually uppercase - think calligraphic script)
Loop | In some typefaces, the bowl created in the descender of the lowercase G
Spur | The extention that articulates the junction of a curved and rectilinear stroke (b, q, G)
Tail | The curved or diagonal stroke at the finish of certain letterforms (Q, j)
Serif | The right-angled or oblique foot at the end of the stroke (A, T, M)
Stem | The significant vertical or oblique stroke (T, V, b, p)
Terminal | The self-contained finish of a stroke without a serif. This is something of a catch0all term. Terminals may be flat (T) flared, acute (t) grave, concave, convex or rounded as a ball or a teardrop (see finial)

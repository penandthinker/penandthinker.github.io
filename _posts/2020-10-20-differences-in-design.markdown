**Visual Design** - Visual design, on the surface level, is the result of what is seen. This includes typography, grid, layout, color and shape, iconography, illustration, images and composition, and animation and motion.

**UI** - User interface design is visual design of the interactive elements. These can be anything from animations, form fields, navigation, and more. UI designers take the framework from UX designers and translates them into visual design comparables before being sent to developers and engineers for production.

**UX** - User experience is the experience that a user has when interacting with a product or service. UX design is the application of creating a product or service to meet the needs of the user through a UX-based design process.

**Web Design** - Web design is the conceptualization, creation, and arrangement of content intended for the internet.
